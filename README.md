## Getting Started

The skeleton of the project has been set up. Please fork this respository and name it [yourname]_bdbchallenge. 

The challenge is straightforward to make a TikTok clone. We would like to test how you approach this task. 

## Set up Backend

To populate the frontend, a backend needs to be setup. Therefore the following steps have to be executed:

1. Make sure you have been added to our firebase project. If not, please send us your credentials.
2. Connect [firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/flutter-test-94ae9/firestore/data/~2Fhotels~2FoXa4IeNN82jnm00JrC3o) with your project. 
3. Set up a model regarding the collection in the database

## Set up Frontend

If you have not already done so, fork this respository to your github account. Then, clone the respository and install the dependencies. The design can be found on [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ZCNPZDoEI8KlBqCD0sYSae/Flutter-test-design?node-id=0%3A1&t=eCfVW1TIgV8R6Q23-0). The video is added to the repository. The video has been added for your reference, to demonstrate what kind of scrolling functionality we are hoping for. 

## Retrieve Data

The retrieval of data is simple, we would only like you to play the video and have the hotel name displayed.

### Implement Video Components

Please anaylze the design carefully. Make sure the video widget is set up in a way that showcase the best possible seamless experience over the current solutions. 

## Complete the Challenge

Do not commit on this respository. Make sure you have the right design, architecture and the functionality working. Think about the structure of the widgets and the type of widgets used. 

**Good luck & have fun!! 🚀**
